\arguments{
\item{pca_scores}{Data frame or matrix with PC scores}

\item{uncertainty}{Proportion of axis range for uncertainty radius}

\item{grid_resolution}{Number of grid cells along each axis}

\item{monte_carlo_iterations}{Number of Monte Carlo replicates}

\item{bootstrap_iterations}{Number of bootstrap resamples}

\item{bootstrap_sample_size}{Optional subsample size for bootstrap iterations.
If NULL (default), uses full dataset. Values <= 1 are treated as fractions
(e.g., 0.5 = 50% of data). Values > 1 are treated as absolute counts.
Useful for comparing datasets with different sample sizes by normalizing
to the smallest dataset size.}

Detect Morphospace Gaps with Uncertainty Quantification
}
\details{
The function implements a rigorous two-stage uncertainty analysis:

\strong{Stage 1: Measurement Uncertainty (Monte Carlo)}
Each observed point is treated as uncertain within ±u (uncertainty * axis range).
For each Monte Carlo iteration, points are perturbed according to the
uncertainty model (Gaussian or uniform). Grid cells are marked as occupied
if any perturbed point falls within the occupancy radius. The gap probability
for each cell is the proportion of iterations where it remains unoccupied.

\strong{Stage 2: Sampling Uncertainty (Bootstrap)}
To assess whether gaps are artifacts of limited sampling, the dataset is
resampled (with replacement) B times. For each resample, the Monte Carlo
procedure is repeated and a binary gap mask is created. The gap stability
for each cell is the proportion of bootstrap iterations where it was
classified as a gap.

\strong{Combined Certainty}
gap_certainty = gap_probability * gap_stability
This represents the probability that a region is genuinely unoccupied,
accounting for both measurement and sampling uncertainty.

gaps_cretaceous <- detect_morphospace_gaps(
